## Overview
It was a good project for a beginner. The background colors confused me a bit and I'm still not sure I got it right.

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process
1. I studied the project design closely.
2. I went through the docs that came with it especially instructions.
3. I designed in my head, making a mental note of the html markup, syntax and css style tools.
4. I wrote the html markup.
I went ahead to style it in my css.
5. Made some changes in my html.
6. Then finished up the design in my css.
7. And then added mobile responsiveness.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Web-first workflow


### What I learned


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 0px 4px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```


### Continued development

1. Positioning.
2. Flexbbox.
3. Grid.
4. Box-shadow.
